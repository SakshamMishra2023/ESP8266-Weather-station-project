# ESP8266-Weather-station-project

This project is a compact IoT-based weather station designed and built using a NodeMCU microcontroller and a DHT sensor to measure temperature and humidity. It demonstrates my skills in hardware integration, programming, and real-time data analysis.
Features

    # Hardware:
        NodeMCU microcontroller for connectivity and control.
        DHT11/DHT22 sensor for accurate temperature and humidity measurements.
    # Software:
        Data acquisition and processing using Arduino IDE.
        Real-time data visualization via serial monitor or a web interface.
        Wi-Fi-enabled data transmission for remote monitoring.
